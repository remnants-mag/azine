			<p class="info">If on mobile, click <a href="./assets/january.pdf">here</a>. <br> Remnants believes what is most interesting about each person
				is what they do and think about between what they do and
				think about. Large categories dominate our lives — work,
				leisure, relationship, hobbies — and our identities are often secured by these categories. But what about all the in between moments? All the things we do and think about that don't fit neatly into a category?<br><br>
				We are introducing remnants to fill this gap. To provide a
				space for us to put forth and showcase parts of our lives that
				cannot be packaged into these categories. To be and create
				how we want to be and create. And to demonstrate how we
				can secure our own identities for ourselves across the various
				categories and gaps of our lives.<br><br>
				We hope you enjoy this first collection.</p>

				<p class="right-text">It started earnestly. Getting something a bit different when
					shopping before the new school year: a cool shirt from Kohl's
					or Old Navy, something I hadn't worn before. I was limited by
					these local department stores and retail chains, but still, these
					little steps led me into an interest area.</p>

					<p class="top-text">Later, a year in France didn't hurt — it exposed me to a lot of
						style I hadn't seen before. It was there that I became aware of
						the street. I learned that I wanted to be seen – that I liked the
						feeling of strangers' eyes looking at me. What do they see?
						What do they think of me?</p>

						felt I could no longer see myself. I was folding into repeated
						routines and slow schedules. The allure and rush of changing
						my appearance fell flat.</p>

						lull in the pandemic helped. Also, posting photos of myself.
						Breaking down this self-conscious barrier led me to rediscover
						some of my earlier excitement amidst the dark grey weight of
						the pandemic.<br>
						&emsp; &emsp; Soon, I understood my excitement as an act of self-
						affirmation: I have put together this outfit with thought and
						intention, I was saying, and by sharing it publicly I affirm my
						vision of myself. Unable to be seen physically, I discovered a way
						to be seen digitally — to force myself to be seen.</p>
